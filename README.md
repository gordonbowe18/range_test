Using the range function to create a fizzbuzz game
This is one of the first projects I worked on, it being a pretty simple counting game. Every multiple of three gives 'fizz', and every multiple of five gives 'buzz'. 
I have tried to reduce the number of unhappy paths by having validation of the numbers given with the isdigit function, and an if else loop to say if the list should be ascending or decending.
I would also like to use this repo as a learning point for github: updating it using commits.
